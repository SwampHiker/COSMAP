# COSMAP
COSine MAtrix Predictor is an approach and a neural network for protein-protein interaction prediction. 


Two folders containing PKLs of trained networks and ZIP with should be availible at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ie4GQh8ocsVjxe9ssAzMpX9lLP7tsY1D?usp=drive_link).

The code has next dependencies:
- numpy
- torch
- pytorch-lightning   (better pre 2.0.0, Lightning often regress)
- pytorch-msssim
- matplotlib   (for notebooks)
- biopython   (for PDB processing)
- scipy  (solely for cdist(..) fucntion)

Also contains C source code of repaired version of PULCHRA program, which allows to restore all atoms (except some hydrogens) from protein backbone (alpha carbons).
